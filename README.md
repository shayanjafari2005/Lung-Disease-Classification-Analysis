# Lung Disease Classification using Hybrid Deep Learning Models

This is a research project focused on the analysis and implementation of the paper **"Explainable hybrid transformer for multi-classification of lung disease using chest X-rays" (LungMaxViT)**.

## Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to explore and implement advanced deep learning architectures for the diagnosis of multiple lung diseases from Chest X-ray (CXR) images. This repository documents the process of understanding and building a hybrid model that combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers.

## Key Areas of Study
- **Hybrid Architectures:** Implementing a model that uses CNNs for local feature extraction and a Transformer (MaxViT) for capturing global relationships.
- **Datasets:** Working with public medical imaging datasets like **COVID-QU-Ex** and **Chest X-ray14**.
- **Preprocessing:** Applying techniques such as CLAHE and Denoising to improve image quality.
- **Transfer Learning:** Utilizing models pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuning them for the medical imaging task.
- **Explainability:** Using methods like Grad-CAM to interpret model decisions and visualize results.

## Current Status
This repository is currently under development. The initial phases involve setting up the environment, analyzing the source paper, and implementing the core components of the model.
